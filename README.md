1. **Responsive Design for Mobile Phones**:
   - Utilize responsive design techniques to ensure that your application works well on mobile phones and other smaller screens. You may need to use media queries in your CSS to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.

2. **Cart Data Storage**:
   - To store cart data for non-logged-in users and avoid data loss on page refresh, you can use browser local storage or session storage. Implement logic to save and retrieve cart items from local storage.

3. **User Profile Update**:
   - Implement a mechanism to update the user profile information instantly without requiring a page refresh. You can use JavaScript to update the displayed username once the user successfully signs up.

4. **Improved Design**:
   - Enhance the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) by improving the overall design. Consider modern UI design principles, use animations, and ensure a visually appealing layout.

5. **User Address and Payment Details**:
   - To enable users to place orders, implement forms for users to enter their delivery address and payment details securely. Consider integrating a payment gateway for processing payments.

6. **Search for Different Cities**:
   - Implement a feature to allow users to search for restaurants in different cities. You might need to expand your data sources or API integration to support multiple cities.

7. **CORS Issue**:
   - If you're experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues, make sure your server-side code and API requests are properly configured to handle CORS. Additionally, consider deploying your application with a backend server to avoid CORS problems when fetching data from external APIs.

8. **Documentation**:
   - Ensure that your project has clear and up-to-date documentation for developers who want to run it locally or contribute to it. Include instructions on dependencies, configuration, and how to set up the development environment.

9. **Testing**:
   - Implement automated testing for your application to ensure that new changes and features don't introduce regressions. Consider using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.

10. **Feedback and User Engagement**:
    - Implement features for users to provide feedback and ratings for restaurants. Engage with your user base to gather insights on what they like and dislike about the application.

11. **Security**:
    - Pay special attention to security when handling user data, especially payment information. Implement security best practices to protect user data and prevent security vulnerabilities.

12. **Performance Optimization**:
    - Optimize the performance of your application by reducing load times, minimizing the use of unnecessary resources, and optimizing code.

Remember to keep your project's dependencies and libraries up to date, and consider version control (e.g., Git) for better collaboration and code management. Continuously iterate on your project based on user feedback and emerging technologies to make it better over time.
